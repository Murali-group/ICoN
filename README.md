# ICoN
Integration using Co-attention across biological Networks

## Generate protein embedding
1. To set up the environment, run the commands in icon_env.txt file.
2. To run ICoN with the best hyperparameters on yeast networks, run (from project folder)
    ```
   python code/main_icon.py code/config/icon_best_yeast.json
   ```
4. You can change the hyperparameters or the networks you are integrating by editing or creating a new config file in code/config.

   i. To run co-attention based ablation study on ICoN use the config file: [icon_no-coattn_yeast.json](https://github.com/Murali-group/ICoN/blob/main/code/config/icon_no-coattn_yeast.json)
   
   ii. To run noise induction module based ablation study on ICoN use the config file: [icon_no-noise_yeast.json](https://github.com/Murali-group/ICoN/blob/main/code/config/icon_no-noise_yeast.json)

   iii. To run ICoN on yeast networks each corrupted with 30%  false positive and false negative edges, use:  [icon_best_noisy03_yeast.json](https://github.com/Murali-group/ICoN/blob/main/code/config/icon_best_noisy03_yeast.json)

   iv. To run ICoN on yeast networks each corrupted with 50%  false positive and false negative edges, use:  [icon_best_noisy05_yeast.json](https://github.com/Murali-group/ICoN/blob/main/code/config/icon_best_noisy05_yeast.json)

## Evaluate generated embedding
We utilized [BIONIC-evals](https://github.com/duncster94/BIONIC-evals) [[1]](#1) to evaluate embeddings generated by ICoN and compare ICoN with other unsupervised biological network integration models.
The details for reproducing the figures in the paper are outlined [here](https://github.com/Murali-group/ICoN/edit/main/eval/README.md).
