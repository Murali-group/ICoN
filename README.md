# ICoN
Integration using Co-attention across biological Networks

## Generate protein embedding
1. To set up the environment, run the commands in icon_env.txt file.
2. To train the ICoN model, run <code/main_icon.py>.
     ```
     python main_icon.py config/icon_yeast_gi_coex_ppi.json
     ```
4. You can change the hyperparameters or the networks you are integrating by editing or creating a new config file in <code/config>.

## Evaluate generated embedding
We utilized [BIONIC-evals](https://github.com/duncster94/BIONIC-evals) (Duncan Forster and congyoua (2022) “duncster94/BIONIC-evals: v0.2.0”. Zenodo. doi: 10.5281/zenodo.6964943.) to evaluate embeddings generated by ICoN and compare ICoN with other unsupervised biological network integration models.
The details for reproducing the figures in the paper are outlined here.
