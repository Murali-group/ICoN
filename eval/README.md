To evaluate ICoN in terms of downstream tasks: i. gene module detection, ii.gene coannotation prediction, and  iii. gene function prediction we utilized [BIONIC-evals](https://github.com/duncster94/BIONIC-evals).

We have provided the [datasets](https://github.com/Murali-group/ICoN/tree/main/eval/datasets/), standards, [config](https://github.com/Murali-group/ICoN/tree/main/eval/config/), and script used in creating figured in the manuscript of ICoN. To reproduce these figures follow the instructions below:
1. First install BIONIC-evals following the instructions given here in [BIONIC-evals](https://github.com/duncster94/BIONIC-evals)
2. Place our provided <script> folder in <BIONIC-evals/bioniceval> folder. 
3. Now in the <BIONIC-evals/bioniceval> folder in your machine, replace the following folders with our provided folders [here](https://github.com/Murali-group/ICoN/tree/main/eval) under the same name:
   i. datasets
   ii. config
   iii. standards
